# AOC_2024
This repository contains my solutions of AOC  2024 puzzles.

## Description
Advent of Code is an annual online event where participants solve a set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to 25th, following the format of an Advent calendar; essentially, it's a fun way to practice coding skills by tackling various algorithmic challenges with a festive twist, allowing users to choose any programming language to solve the puzzles.
## More info
This is my first participation in AOC since it has been started for 10 years. This is a 25 day competition in which each day you need to solve 2 puzzles and upon solving first puzzle you will be acess to solve second puzzle. Like this if you get 50 stars at the end, it signifies you have solved all the puzzles in this year. And below is my progress of AOC 2024.
